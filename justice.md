Proper use of the model could increase justice in the following ways:  

First, proper use of this model ensures early detection of cyberbullying. It informs the user of measures they can take to mitigate harmful activity. This education essentially empowers the user by reminding them of the resources and actions available. Additionally, this early detection could ensure intervention by parents, teachers, and other parties to prevent the issue from increasing in scale. This increases justice because it prevents a user from experiencing harm. Furthermore, if the user chooses to flag or block an account, it also helps prevent harm to other individuals. 

Second, properly using this model can lead to research that can make real-life interventions more effective. The trends identified about cyberbullying and teenagers throughout the analysis of this model should be shared and used to inform researchers, parents, educators, and policymakers to discern between effective and ineffective interventions and regulation of social media content. This increases justice because cyberbullying is a societal issue driven by real-life problems such as economic conditions, political climate, and more. Proper use of this model can help us understand what drives cyberbullying, what interventions are most commonly chosen, as well as more that can help tackle cyberbullying at its root.
